JFS — JavaScript Forms Library
==================================================

Description
--------------------------------------
JFS is a JavaScript forms library that I originally wrote while working at John Brown University
to standardize the creation of and interaction with web forms. It depends on [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

NOTE: Pre-1.4.4 versions included icons from the excellent [FAMFAMFAM Silk icons made by Mark James](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/).
